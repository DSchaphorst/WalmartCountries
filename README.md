# WalmartCountries
 
Coding Challenge for Walmart

**Objective**
Create a recycler view (not using Compose) that displays each country's "name", "region", "code" and "capital" found in this JSON: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/peymano-wmt/32dcb892b06648910ddd40406e37fdab/raw/db25946fd77c5873b0303b858e861ce724e0dcd0/countries.json

**Solution**
This project was attempted to be kept as minimal as possible. The only major tools implemented are as follows:
Retrofit
OKHTTP
Coroutines 

First created simple data and UI for displaying the data as requested. Then connected to the network and pulled data from JSON. Finally set data to the recycler view.
